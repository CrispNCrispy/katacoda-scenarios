# Welcome!

Deep Learning (DL) is the set of techniques that work especially well with computer vision and natural language processing tasks. DL is the part of a broader area called Machine Learning (ML).

This katacoda is the third one in the 'Computer Vision with TensorFlow' series. This scenario focuses on classificaiton of the Fashion MNIST dataset using a convolution neural network - particularly using the LeNet-5 architecture.

To take the most of this course, you should know how to program in Python or another language that would allow you to understand Python syntax.
