# Congratulations!
You've completed the third Computer Vision with TensorFlow scenario.

You've learned the foundational concepts of Machine Learning and Computer Vision using TensorFlow, here's a quick summary of key takeaways from this katacoda:

* Training a convolution neural network with convolution layers and average pooling layers
* Loading and preparing the Fashion MNIST data by normalizing, expanding the dimension and padding
* Creating and compiling the model
* Fitting and evaluating the model
