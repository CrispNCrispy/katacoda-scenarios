# Congratulations!
You've completed the first Computer Vision with TensorFlow task scenario.

You've learned the foundational concepts of Machine Learning and Computer Vision using TensorFlow, here's a quick summary of key takeaways from this katacoda:

* Training a Single Layer Model for a regression problem
# Training a lager neural network for a classification problem
* Loading and preparing the Fashion MNIST data
* Training a Dense Neural Network on the Fasion MNIST data
