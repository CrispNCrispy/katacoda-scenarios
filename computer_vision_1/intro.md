# Welcome!

Deep Learning (DL) is the set of techniques that work especially well with computer vision and natural language processing tasks. DL is the part of a broader area called Machine Learning (ML).

This katacoda is the first one in the 'Computer Vision with TensorFlow' series. This scenario will introduce the foundations of DL by training a neural network for a simple regression and classificaiton problem using keras.

To take the most of this course, you should know how to program in Python or another language that would allow you to understand Python syntax.
