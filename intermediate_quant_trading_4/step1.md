**Bollinger Bands** are a type of chart indicator for technical analysis and have become widely used by traders in many markets, including stocks, futures, and currencies. Created by John Bollinger in the 1980s, the bands offer unique insights into price and volatility. In fact, there are a number of uses for Bollinger Bands, such as determining overbought and oversold levels, as a trend following tool, and for monitoring for breakouts.

Bollinger Bands are composed of three lines. One of the more common calculations uses a 20-day simple moving average (SMA) for the middle band. The upper band is calculated by taking the middle band and adding twice the daily standard deviation to that amount. The lower band is calculated by taking the middle band minus two times the daily standard deviation.

If the price is near the upper Bollinger Band, it’s considered “expensive” because it is 2 standard deviation above the average (the 20-period moving average).

And if the is price near the lower Bollinger Band, it’s considered “cheap” because it’s 2 standard deviation below the average.

Now that you know about Bollinger Bands, let's move on to creating the strategy!
