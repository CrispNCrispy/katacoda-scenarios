For this step, we are going to add another 2 elements:
* Commission 
* Profit on every buy/sell cycle

To add commission charges, one single line will suffice: cerebro.broker.setcommission(commission=x)

For obtaining profit on every cycle, we introduce another function called 'notify_trade' which gets called on every execution, but we will use it to output profit whenever a trade has closed (or sold).

Create a .py file.

Read the code, read the comments and execute the code to observe:
* Close prices of every day in 2019.
* Buy orders and executions when the price drops 3 days in a row.
* Sell orders and executions 5 bars after a stock has been bought.
* Gross profit, net profit and commission amount after sell execution.
* Change in our portfolio value after commission.

Note: Buying and selling of only 1 stock is happening as of right now.

```
python step3.py

```{{execute}}

After all this, we still made a profit of $23. Of course, the return would have been larger had we bought more than one stock.

With all this knowledge in mind, we will now proceed to the next scenario where we will use whatever we have learnt to create actual trade strategies!
